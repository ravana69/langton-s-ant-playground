# Langton's Ant Playground

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/tsuhre/pen/JrdZLv](https://codepen.io/tsuhre/pen/JrdZLv).

Please post your favorite patterns in the comments!

A Playground for trying out different Langtons Ant rulesets. This uses the Turk and Propp model for using arbitrary rulesets. For more information on langtons ant, see the link below:

Many of the patterns remind me of bismuth crystals.

An interesting and unsolved Math problem involving Langtons Ant is to prove if a given variation will eventually result in a highway (a series of repeated movements with no variation).
